abstract: As the Pharmaceutical sector boosts its interactions with regulatory agencies using R programming as one key instrument for drug development submissions, we face a dilemma that several members of statistics and statistical programming teams are not currently advanced R programmers. For many years SAS has been a powerful tool in the data analysis repertoire of pharma statisticians however the recent development of automation capabilities such as RMarkdown and R/Shiny have created a new venue to expedite access to consumable information in the form of reports, presentations or interactive graphics that can be produced efficiently and in standard format for all phases of a drug development or submission process. At Janssen we aim to improve the literacy in R programming and achieve nearly 100% adhesion by statistics and statistical programming teams in the coming 2-3 years. To achieve this goal, we are leveraging all types of training formats, from online training, to in-house instructor led seminar, to one-on-one mentoring. One of the key methods we have been developing is the use of RStudio.Cloud as a platform for internal crowd-led hands-on workshops where statisticians/programmers are "thought" to solve on-the-job real problems ranging from visualization to automated reports. In this presentation we will discuss our experience creating this program and share lessons learned, mistakes and successes.
