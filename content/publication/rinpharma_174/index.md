abstract: Julia is a modern programming language that provides the ease of use of R with the speed of C++. Julia has been in development for over 11 years. Research on Julia originated at MIT in 2009. Julia is powered by multiple dispatch - a generalization of both, object oriented programming and functional programming. Julia's multiple dispatch makes it easy to write programs at a high level of abstraction while simultaneously getting high performance. This has led to Julia being used by over 10,000 companies and 1,500 universities worldwide. Pumas, developed in Julia, integrates mechanistic pharmacometric models with Scientific Machine Learning and neural networks. In a recent case study, we demonstrated 175x speedup for a QSP workload. Pumas is designed for every type of analysis scientists perform throughout the drug development lifecycle in one seamless environment. Leveraging Julia's parallel capabilities, Pumas leverages distributed computing and GPUs and runs on the cloud through the JuliaHub platform. These workflows leverage the Julia's database, statistics, and visualization functionality in a single package.
