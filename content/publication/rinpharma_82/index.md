abstract: The R shiny-based nest framework (previously named teal) has been proven valuable in exploratory settings and supporting strategic decision meetings. To allow more clinical studies to be able to adopt this agile framework in a wider range, we've developed a R package osprey and its accompanying R-shiny modules package teal.osprey, for the summarization, analysis and visualization of safety and early efficacy data. At its current development stage, the packages provide standard safety tables and several plots, covering adverse events, disposition, tumor burden, response data and a few other domains. The packages inherited the code reproducibility and interactive dynamic filtering functionality, allowing seamless integration with the previously-existing modules in the nest framework.
