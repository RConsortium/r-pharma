abstract: Objectives Demonstrate an interactive and dynamic visualization tool, ModViz POP, for simulating ordinary differential equations based PK/PD models with variability. Methods ModViz POP has an in built PKPD ODE library of models based on the compartmental nomenclature for simulating standard IV bolus, infusion and first order absorption scenarios. It also gives the user the ability to plug in a model from local directory to quickly simulate a model of interest. Users can also simulate from a project library which serves as a repository of final PK/PD models developed by individual project teams. Beyond the PK/PD models, it can handle complex QSP models and PBPK models equally well. Enhanced R packages, HTML/CSS, LATEX in combination with Shiny were used and provided an elegant and powerful programming framework for turning models into a web application with dynamic visualization and automated report writing. The user interface consists of several key inputs for performing the simulations. A tabbed navigation allows the user to visualize the plots, input parameters, derived values and equations. It provides the ability to download the underlying model, plots, simulated data or a comprehensive report consisting of all the key inputs and outputs of the simulations. The Help button provides a link to documentation with detailed instructions on different components of the interface. The interface also includes advanced features where users can overlay external data on over simulated data, set a certain simulation scenario as a reference or carry out sensitivity analysis based simulations. Conclusions This easy to use interface can serve as a valuable tool for teams to explore and evaluate potential scenarios and thus facilitate collaborative decision making in the drug discovery and development paradigm.
