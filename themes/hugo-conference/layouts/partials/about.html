<p>R/Pharma is an ISC working group (<a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-
working-groups">www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups</a>) under the R Consortium. The conference is envisioned as a relatively small, scientifically &amp;
industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The
conference will cover topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation,
safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research &amp; development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics,
genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All will be discussed within the context of using R as a
primary tool within the drug development process. The conference will showcase the current use of R
that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery &amp; development, and clinical initiatives.
(Note that topics related to the use of R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and
researchers will likely be the focus of the upcoming R/Medicine conference.)</p>

<p>The conference will be a single track conference consisting of keynotes from renowned industry
practitioners to key R developers to leading academics, pre-conference workshops and full-length
presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.</p>

<p>R/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability or any feature that distinguishes human beings.
