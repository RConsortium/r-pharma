abstract: R Shiny has revolutionized the way statisticians and analysts distribute analytic results and research methods. We can easily build interactive web tools that enhance data visualization and facilitate data and information sharing. Shiny apps can empower non-statisticians to explore and visualize their data or perform their own analyses with methods we develop. Harnessing this power, R users have developed Shiny apps for visualizing clinical trials and pharmaceutical data, as well as applications that aid in study design and analysis. I will present examples of how Shiny can be used in many stages of the drug development process and discuss the challenges as well as benefits of incorporating these tools in pharmaceutical workflows.
