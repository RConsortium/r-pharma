abstract: The tidyverse (tidyverse.org) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The packages primarily consist of tools for data ingest, manipulation, and visualization. In the last year or so, Rstudio and others have been creating a set of packages focused on the modeling process. In this talk, we will introduce the tidyverse and illustrate these new tools whose goals are to simplify the modeling process, encourage empirical validation and good methodology, and to enable a wider variety of approaches.
