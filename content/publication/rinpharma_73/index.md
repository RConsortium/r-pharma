abstract: The gsDesign package for group sequential design is widely used with >30k downloads. The package was originally written in 2007 with substantial documentation and Runit testing created before 2010. A Shiny interface was created to make the package more approachable in about 2015. Recent efforts have focused on updating package to use Roxygen2, pkgdown, covr/covrpage and testthat as well as changing vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown. The learning curve for this modernization will be discussed as well as usage in a regulated environment.
