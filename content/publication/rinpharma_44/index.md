abstract: For the Pharma Company How many times have you made a graph and gotten an email back saying "Can we change the axes?" or "Can we change the symbols?" or "I really need to look at the graph before I can tell you what I want". It would be much more efficient for your customers to explore the data and the visualizations in an easy-to-use method and can free you up to work on the myriad other tasks you have to do. Rather than learn another programming language, the shiny package uses the R code you already know to create interactive visualizations with a small bit of additional learning. This talk will go over example dashboards for such data as adverse events, labs, and primary endpoints that will aid data managers, statisticians, clinical people, and... even you.
