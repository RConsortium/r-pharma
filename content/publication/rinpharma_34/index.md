abstract: Interactive web graphics are a popular and convenient medium for conveying information. However, web graphics are rarely used during the initial exploratory phase of a data analysis, largely due to the lack tools for seamless iteration between data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. As we've known for several decades, interactive graphics can augment exploratory analysis, but are only practical when we can iterate quickly. This talk demonstrates how to use the R packages plotly and dashR to rapidly produce interactive web graphics and applications that augment data exploration in addition to being easily distributed.
