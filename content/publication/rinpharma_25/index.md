abstract: Failure to thoroughly review discrepancies and deviations in drug manufacturing is consistently one of the top citations in FDA inspectional observations. Learn how a leading biotechnology organization successfully replaced an inefficient, manual inspection process with a genealogy visualization and inspection solution to optimize drug manufacturing quality control. This session will cover implementation approaches and lessons learned in data mapping, technology selection, visualization development, and predictive model generation.
