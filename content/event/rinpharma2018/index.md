The R / Pharma conference began as grass-roots initiative led by data scientists working in
the pharmaceutical industry to promote the use of R in Pharma, and to establish and share
best practices. The founding members organized the project as an R Consortium working
group, and undertook the ambitious task of launching an annual conference envisioned as a
relatively small, collegial, industry-oriented event with a strong scientific program.

Keynotes (https://bit.ly/2SdvMNd) were presented by Lilliam Rosario of the FDA’s
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Michael Lawrence Genentech/Roche and the R
Core Group, and Max Kuhn and Joe Cheng from RStudio.
Over forty-five talks and workshops were delivered with topics ranging from reproducible research, regulatory constraints and considerations, and package administration
to scaling R for production. A considerable number of talks emphasized the development
of production-grade Shiny applications. Although considerably larger than most of the
Shiny applications developed, Roche’s 500,000 line application, which was presented at
the conference and subsequently written up in a post (https://bit.ly/2NeXKFJ), reflects a
common use case.
