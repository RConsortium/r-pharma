abstract: Developing Shiny applications that meet design goals, easily deploy to multiple platforms, and contain easily maintainable components (all while adhering to best practices) is typically a difficult endeavor. Until recently, there has not been a tool addressing the optimal development workflow and construction of Shiny apps. The {golem} package by Think-R offers an opinionated framework for creating a Shiny app as a package, with {usethis}-like functionality to add a diverse set of capabilities. In this presentation, I will share how {golem} enables a robust standard for Shiny development and how it magically brought a dormant application back to life.
