abstract: This workshop is introductory and open to everyone assuming basic R/Data Science skills. Please note, the workshop is very hands-on oriented, so expect to get your fingers dirty! The aim will be an introduction to ANNs in R. ANNs form the basic unit of deep learning and are immensely powerful in predictive modelling, but not without pitfalls. In this workshop, we will be working with conceptually understanding what an ANN is, how we train an ANN and how predictions are subsequently made. We will also touch upon parameters, hyper-parameters and how to handle data all in context of model over-fitting. All of the aforementioned will be done using TensorFlow via Keras for R.
