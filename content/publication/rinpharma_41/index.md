abstract: When it comes to analytics of data collected in medical research, today’s culture is compartmentalized – not only across institutions, but even within institutions. Such a culture stagnates analytical development and limits the ability to fully master the data thereby reducing the effectiveness in communicating clinical information to stakeholders. A unified culture can exist – statisticians, programmers, and clinicians need to speak to each other; regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and academics need to speak to each other. Once everyone comes together to discuss how the medical research data should be collected, interrogated and presented; analytics can be developed and shared within and across institutions. From an analytics perspective, nothing new needs to be developed, solutions are already available – many of them free. We just need to come together and start talking. So let’s talk.
