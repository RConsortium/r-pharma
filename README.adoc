R/Pharma website: [rinpharma.com](http://rinpharma.com)

## General framework

This website is based on the `Hugo` theme `starter-research-group`, a
fork off the `academic` theme. The theme documentation is shared - and available
at [wowchemy.com/docs/](https://wowchemy.com/docs/).

## `gsheet` as source of truth

We use [this gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NaDnMRh2nOBCzBUxbIyJBVWd_InaEMLTW0rEJtD2ywE/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110502841866540588057)
as a source of truth for the proceedings (abstracts of talks) and the list of
organisors.
