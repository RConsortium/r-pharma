abstract: The drake package is a general-purpose workflow manager for data-driven tasks in R, with applications in the pharmaceutical industry ranging from tailored medicine to clinical trial simulation and beyond. Drake rebuilds intermediate data objects when their dependencies change, and it skips work when the results are already up to date. Not every runthrough starts from scratch, and completed workflows have tangible evidence of reproducibility. Drake is more scalable than knitr, more thorough than memoization, and more R-focused than other pipeline toolkits such as GNU Make, remake, and snakemake.
