The first annual R/Pharma conference will be held Wednesday, August 15th and Thursday, August 16th at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.

R/Pharma is an [ISC working group](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups) under the R Consortium. The conference is envisioned as a relatively small, scientifically & industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The conference will cover topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research & development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All will be discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development process. The conference will showcase the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery & development, and clinical initiatives. (Note that topics related to the use of R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and researchers will likely be the focus of the upcoming R/Medicine conference.)

The conference will be a single track conference consisting of keynotes from renowned industry practitioners to key R developers to leading academics, pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.


R/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability or any feature that distinguishes human beings.
