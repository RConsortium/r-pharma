abstract: Predictive modeling is a powerful tool, which amongst other things can be applied for prioritising drug candidates. Limiting the search space needed for target exploration, can reduce costs markedly partly eliminating lab time and expensive kits. Predictive modeling is however not without pitfalls... In this short talk, I will present a (fictive) data science case story, outlining one major challenge in predictive modeling, while demonstrating how to address said challenge.
