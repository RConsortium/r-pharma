abstract: Research is an incremental, iterative process, with new results relying and building upon previous ones. Scientists need to find, retrieve, understand, and trust results in order to confidently extend them, even when the results are their own. We present the GREX framework, which facilitates this iterative process via the principled management of computational results. GREX combines robust storage, provenance tracking, automated annotation, discoverability, and reproduciblity of computational results. We will discuss both the underlying conceptual work and our reference implementation of our framework.
