Douglas Robinson has worked for Novartis for over eleven years with his most recent role of leading the Scientific Computing and Consulting (SCC) team, which was founded on January 1, 2019.  The mission of SCC is to enable clinical teams to change how they interact with and interpret their data.  Before this, he led the Biomarkers and Diagnostics team at Novartis for ten years, which was accountable for exploring the late phase oncology clinical trial data and for the submission of diagnostic assays to the health authority that complement the targeted therapies in oncology. 


Prior to joining Novartis, Doug worked at Bristol-Myers Squibb as a biomarker statistician, responsibly for assessing genetic and genomic biomarker data collected as part of the immunology and oncology programs.  He received his PhD from North Carolina State University in 2003 with a focus on Statistical Genetics.
