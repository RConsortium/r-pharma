R/Pharma 2021 hopes to continue our tradition of diversity scholarships.

The R/Pharma ISC Working Group (through the R Consortium) values diversity and
is focused on helping to encourage and support diversity and inclusion in the R/Pharma Community.
To help fund the grants, we plan to use the proceeds from the conference
merchandise found on our store here: https://www.bonfire.com/store/r-in-pharma/

The store will remain open until Sunday, 18th October.

In the long run, we hope that the R/Pharma conference participants reflect
the full diversity of the world around us. We believe in building on-ramps
so that people from diverse backgrounds can learn R, build their knowledge,
and then contribute back to the pharma community.
