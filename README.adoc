**Currently site is here**: http://insightsengineering.com/

Final: R/Pharma website: http://rinpharma.com[rinpharma.com]

## Urgent to-do

Schedules look terrible::
    The files `layouts/partials/rinpharmaXXXX.html` need editing (along with
      CSS added) to improve the look of the conference specific schedules.

Schedules data management is clunky::
    Currently we have a separate layout for each conference, as I couldn't
    figure out yet in Hugo how to pass down which data file to use.
    This must be possible though - so will need to dive deeper into shortcodes
    and partials in Hugo to see how to do it.

Add in `build_scripts` to `deploy.yml`::
    Quick thing to add - but waiting till I sort out the general look so I don't
    needlessly keep hitting Google's API.

## General framework

This website is based on the `Hugo` theme `starter-research-group`, a
fork off the `academic` theme. The theme documentation is shared - and available
at https://wowchemy.com/docs/[wowchemy.com/docs/].

## Call to action

The 'call to action' (`cta`) is the button that tells people to signup for the
next conference. Enable or disable in the file `content/home/welcome.md`.

## `gsheet` as source of truth

We use https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NaDnMRh2nOBCzBUxbIyJBVWd_InaEMLTW0rEJtD2ywE/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110502841866540588057[this gsheet]
as a source of truth for the proceedings (abstracts of talks) and the list of
organisers. This gsheet is read by the Github action `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
when it rebuilds and deploys the site.

The folders `content/authors/` and `content/publications/` are built in the CICD
process - so editing them in the site code has no effect. You must edit the
gsheet.

The CICD process also build the _rinpharmaXXXX_ `.yml` files in `data/` that
have the schedule data for each conference.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to update the gdoc if you want to edit the proceedings, schedule or list of people.

### Accessing the data (e.g. for shiny apps)

The gsheet data (minus information people might not want shared like emails) is
 written to a public Rstudio 'pins' dataset,
which can be accessed by other services (e.g. a conference specific shiny app),
or to do something like a wordcloud on abstracts.

The data is in this repo https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma-data[github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma-data],
and is written to by the CICD process. You can access it (with no authentication)
via the following code.

[source,R]
library(pins)
board_register_github(repo = "rinpharma/rinpharma-data",branch = "master")
pin_get("proceedings", board = "github")

### proceedings

The sheet `all_conferences` in the main gsheet is used to populate the
_proceedings_ on the site. The CICD process takes the gsheet data and makes an
entry in `publication/` for each talk from the conference.

### team

The sheet `team` in the main gsheet is used to populate the
_people_ section on the site. The CICD process takes the gsheet data and makes an
entry in `authors/` for each person. We can update the `R` code in
`build_scripts` to allow multiple groups here.

NOTE: The profile photos come from the persons Gravater profile. We need to get
people to go https://en.gravatar.com/[that service if they want to to add their image].

### conference schedules

The sheet `all_conferences` in the main gsheet is used to populate the
_schedule_ in each conference event page.

## Deploying the site

NOTE: Humans should not deploy the site, or work directly on `master`.
The site is built automatically by the CICD process in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### As a contributor

- To update the organising team, proceedings content or a schedule - edit the
gsheet.
- To edit the website code - make your edits in a branch and make a PR onto master.
Remember that the CICD process will rebuild (e.g. don't worry about pushing up a
built version of the site, or pulling updates from the gsheet.)

### Details on how `deploy.yml` works

1. The master branch will be protected - so you can only do a PR in
1. When master is updated, it triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to run.
1. This will run the scripts in `/build_scripts/` to update content where
the source of truth is in the `gsheet`. Doing this overwrites folders like
``/content/authors/` and `/content/publications/`.
1. Then the `deploy.yml` script runs a second set of code that will run
Hugo and then publish the output to a detached `gh-pages` branch.
