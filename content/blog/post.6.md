We have chosen to use

<a href="https://hopin.to/" style="text-decoration: underline;">hopin.to</a>
{{< /rawhtml >}}
 to host R/Pharma this year.  Here's a brief guide to some of its features.  

When you enter the platform you'll be in the reception area.  This is one of five main areas within the hopin platform, each will be described briefly below.

#### Reception
The page you see when you first open the app.  It's a place where the conference organizers can push important announcements and where you'll be able to see the schedule.

#### Stage
This is the place where all the talks happen.  Head over here to listen to the speakers

#### Sessions
Sessions is an area for smaller talks, round-tables and discussions with up to 10 on camera and an audience of 500.  Not only can we schedule sessions in the program but you can create them too.  We've left sessions open for impromptu meetings.  Anyone can create a session by just clicking on **Create Session**, filling in a few details and adding an optional picture.  
Sessions can be open, meaning anyone can go on camera, or moderated, meaning that you can manage who goes on camera.  Anyone and everyone can watch sessions.  Want to follow up with a speaker?  Invite them to a session over a virtual coffee.

#### Networking
Networking is our speed-networking area.  When you join you'll be randomly paired with another conference attendee for two minutes and both go on camera.  It's a great way to meet new people, and we all have something in common!  Please consider trying it out - everyone at R/Pharma is nice!  If you find that two minutes isn't enough, you could carry on chatting in a session.

#### Expo
The expo is our virtual exhibition hall.  R/Pharma does not work with sponsors and we promote opensource so the exhibition hall is not a traditional one.  We're using this space to give people a chance to showcase their R packages and shiny apps.  When you enter a booth you can see a video or set of slides highlighting a package or app.  When the author is present in the booth they can interact with you and even show a live demo.  The expo will be open throughout the entire three days of the conference - come check it out.  If you'd like to add a booth, more details are in this
