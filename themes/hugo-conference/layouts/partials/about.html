<p itemprop="description">The second annual R/Pharma conference is planned for August 21, 22, and 23, 2019 at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. A confirmation on this date will appear on this site as soon as the venue booking is confirmed.</p>

<p>Based on feedback, we have devoted a 3rd day to the conference agenda focused completely on R/Pharma workshops for attendees. More info will be available soon.<p>

<p>R/Pharma is an ISC working group (<a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-
working-groups">www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups</a>) under the R Consortium. The conference is envisioned as a relatively small, scientifically &amp;
industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The
conference will cover topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation,
safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research &amp; development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics,
genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All will be discussed within the context of using R as a
primary tool within the drug development process. The conference will showcase the current use of R
that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery &amp; development, and clinical initiatives.
(Note that topics related to the use of R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and
researchers will likely be the focus of the upcoming R/Medicine conference.)</p>

<p>The conference will be a single track conference consisting of keynotes from renowned industry
practitioners to key R developers to leading academics, pre-conference workshops and full-length
presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.</p>

<p>R/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability or any feature that distinguishes human beings.

<h2 class="section-title">Tickets</h2>

<p>We made a decision for our inaugural event to keep things small scale and to focus on establishing the trajectory into the future. Unfortunately in doing so, attendance capacity was scaled back considerably from what we had originally planned. Based on this years success, we plan to open up more spots next year.</p>

<p>The location will be the Center for Government and International Studies in the Tsai Auditorium at Harvard University and capped at 150 attendees.</p>

<p>As of now, we are planning to make the inaugural gathering a free event.</p>

<p>We plan to provide invitations firstly based on committee membership and advisory support, speaker acceptance, academic/student and diversity attendance. We are still determining the best path for opening general attendance and please check the website for updates that will be posted soon.</p>

<p>By design, R / Pharma is deliberately a smaller conference in terms of attendance in order to encourage maximum opportunities for direct interaction with speakers so I don't expect attendance to go over 300 in upcoming years.</p>

<p>Our entire event is a community-lead effort and 100% volunteer run. The event is vendor neutral and very much an academic conference. Harvard has been very helpful in hosting the event.</p>
