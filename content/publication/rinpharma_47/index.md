abstract: The open-source analytics community is driving innovation in precompetitive spaces like statistical methodology, reproducibility approaches, visualization techniques, and scaling strategies. The diverse and rapdily evolving ecosystem of open-source tools and standards stands in contrast with the disposition of the enterprise towards stability, standardization, and reliability. This talk will present the policies and frameworks we have developed at Genentech to enable internal scientists to responsibly leverage open-source tools and to participate in the community process through their own contributions.
