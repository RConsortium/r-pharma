R/Pharma website: http://rinpharma.com[rinpharma.com]

## General framework

This website is based on the `Hugo` theme `starter-research-group`, a
fork off the `academic` theme. The theme documentation is shared - and available
at https://wowchemy.com/docs/[wowchemy.com/docs/].

## `gsheet` as source of truth

We use https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NaDnMRh2nOBCzBUxbIyJBVWd_InaEMLTW0rEJtD2ywE/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110502841866540588057[this gsheet]
as a source of truth for the proceedings (abstracts of talks) and the list of
organisers.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to update the gdoc if you want to edit the proceedings, schedule or list of people.
