We are excited to announce that registration is now open for R/Pharma 2020.  R/Pharma is a free event put on by volunteers.  In order to manage registration we'll be releasing tickets in groups so if you are unable to get one on first attempt please check back.  More details will follow shortly on workshops and schedule.
