abstract: The primary objective of the presentation is to share insights of democratizing powerful natural language processing tool like I2E lingumatics and open source R and Shiny. The talk will focus on how we can leverage I2E python sdk natural language processing toolkit to perform natural language processing and visualize text mining results with R and Shiny. We will present several uses of our R shiny platform called pharmine and its use cases which we developed for minining biomedical data.
