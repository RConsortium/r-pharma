By design, R / Pharma is deliberately a smaller conference in terms of attendance in order to encourage maximum opportunities for direct interaction with speakers. The location will be the Center for Government and International Studies in the Tsai Auditorium at Harvard University and capped at 150 attendees. As of now, we are planning to make the gathering a free event. Invitations are firstly based on committee membership and advisory support, speaker acceptance, academic/student and diversity attendance.

Our entire event is a community-lead effort and 100% volunteer run. The event is vendor neutral and very much an academic conference. Harvard has been very helpful in hosting the event.

R/Pharma is an [ISC working group](www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups) under the R Consortium. The conference is envisioned as a relatively small, scientifically & industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The conference will cover topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research & development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All will be discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development process. The conference will showcase the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery & development, and clinical initiatives. (Note that topics related to the use of R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and researchers will likely be the focus of the upcoming R/Medicine conference.)

The conference will be a single track conference consisting of keynotes from renowned industry practitioners to key R developers to leading academics, pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.

R/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability or any feature that distinguishes human beings. For more information, please see the R Consortium code of conduct.
