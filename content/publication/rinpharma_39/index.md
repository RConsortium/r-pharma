abstract: Despite the explosive growth and adoption of R globally, concerns over how to qualify and administrate R continues to echo in discussions about use in regulated environments. In this talk, I'll discuss the how to bridge the conceptual tenants of reproducibility, traceability, and accuracy to robust, yet agile, implementations such that and organization can maintain validated systems without imposing the shackles found in traditional validated environments. Furthermore, I will discuss a number of design elements specific to the open-source R ecosystem, such as using packages from CRAN and github, and cover how to embrace these, while responsibly managing risk in enterprise environments.
