postSummary: "Get some R/Pharma merch and support diversity"
---

R/Pharma 2021 hopes to continue our tradition of diversity scholarships.

The R/Pharma ISC Working Group (through the R Consortium) values diversity and is focused on helping to encourage and support diversity and inclusion in the R/Pharma Community.  
To help fund the grants, we plan to use the proceeds from the conference merchandise found on our store here:

{{< /rawhtml >}}

The store will remain open until Sunday, 18th October.

In the long run, we hope that the R/Pharma conference participants reflect the full diversity of the world around us. We believe in building on-ramps so that people from diverse backgrounds can learn R, build their knowledge, and then contribute back to the pharma community.
