abstract: R and Biocondutor are important tools supporting scientific workflows across early Research and Development at Roche/Genentech. We have a broad R users community, which includes Data Scientists, Software Developers and consumers of Data Products developed with R. The presentation will explain the guiding principles behind the creation and management of computational environments for Research. The first part will show how we provide shared R environments, which enable result reproducibility and provide access to custom compute resources for interactive data analysis workflows. While the second part will demonstrate how we create corresponding environments for software development, including a brief overview of the tooling and infrastructure, which streamlines the development, testing and deployment of R packages and Shiny applications.
