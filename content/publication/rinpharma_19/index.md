abstract: The dramatic increase of R in the computational, analytics, and data science areas has led to some innovative techniques in recent years for interactive analytics. This rate of change presents challenges for IT organizations to keep up and to maintain their software stacks for scientists for regulated and non-regulated environments. Techniques and Best Practices for managing updates and use cases will be presented from an R-Admin's perspective using a combination of opensource and professional tools.
