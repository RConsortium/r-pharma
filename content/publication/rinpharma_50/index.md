abstract: Shiny is a popular R package that lets users develop interactive web applications using just R code. The ease of use and downstream boost in productivity mean that working with Shiny can kick off a rapid request-implementation-inspiration-request cycle. Designing your applications with an eye toward future expansion can save time and reduce human error in the long term.
