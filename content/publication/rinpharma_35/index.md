abstract: Recent advances in the Shiny ecosystem boost the scale and scope of serious enterprise-wide web applications. More specifically, it is entirely possible to utilize key features of Shiny Server Professional and additional R packages such as shinyjs, DT, and batchtools to build Shiny applications that supports session management, high-performance computing, and reproducibility in a friendly and logical interface. Additionally, the shinytest package enables a robust workflow for developing applications efficiently, as well as being an important component to automate a validation testing framework. In this talk, I will share examples of key features and lessons learned in creating a technically powerful shiny application that integrates these pieces together.
