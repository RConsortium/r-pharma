    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#faq&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design, R / Pharma is deliberately a smaller conference in terms of attendance
in order to encourage maximum opportunities for direct interaction with speakers.
In 2018 and 2019 the conference was held in the Tsai Auditorium at the
Center for Government and International Studies, Harvard University and capped at
150 attendees. The conference was run as a free event. Invitations were based on
committee membership and advisory support, speaker acceptance, academic/student and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference has been run with single track consisting of keynotes from renowned
industry practitioners to key R developers to leading academics. In addition
there were a number of pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as
well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2020 we are taking a hiatus from holding the meeting at Harvard and
will be running a virtual conference. More details will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our entire event is a community-lead effort and 100% volunteer run. The
event is vendor neutral and very much an academic conference. Harvard has been very helpful in hosting the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma is an (ISC working group)[https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups]
under the R Consortium. The conference is a relatively small, scientifically &amp;amp;
industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of
pharmaceuticals. The conference covers topics including reproducible research,
regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug
discovery, research &amp;amp; development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics,
immunogenicity and more. All are discussed within the context of using R as a
primary tool within the drug development process. The conference showcases
the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery
&amp;amp; development, and clinical initiatives. (Note that topics related to the use of
R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and
researchers is the focus of
(R/Medicine)[https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability or any feature that
distinguishes human beings. For more information, please see the R Consortium
code of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
