The 3 hrs will include 6 talks in the first 1.5 hours and then the last 1.5 will be a Shiny workshop.\nHere is the tentative outline:\n Intro: Samantha Toet (RStudio) \u0026amp; Kevin Bolger (ProCogia) RStudio Updates for Pharma: Sean Lopp (RStudio) R/Pharma: Harvey Lieberman (Novartis) Shiny for Submissions: Bob Engle (Biogen) R Validation Hub: Marly Gotti (Biogen) R in Janssen Drug Discovery Statistics: Volha Tryputsen (Janssen) R Validation Framework: Ellis Hughes (Fred Hutch) Shiny Workshop: ProCogia  This session is made up of live talks from industry experts along with a hands-on workshop focused on shiny, infrastructure, tools, and processes that support R submissions. This is a great opportunity to learn and get inspired about new capabilities for creating compelling analyses with applications in drug development using open source languages. Industry leaders from pharmaceutical organizations will share their experiences and best practices for advancing drug development and clinical trials.\nThis short course will provide a hands-on introduction to flexible and powerful tools for statistical analysis, reproducible research, and interactive visualizations. The workshop will include an overview of the Tidyverse for clinical data wrangling, how to build Shiny apps and R Markdown documents, as well as visualizations using HTML Widgets for R.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief guide to some of its features.\nTL;DR - watch this video.\rWhen you enter the platform you\u0026rsquo;ll be in the reception area. This is one of five main areas within the hopin platform, each will be described briefly below.\nReception The page you see when you first open the app. It\u0026rsquo;s a place where the conference organizers can push important announcements and where you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see the schedule.\nStage This is the place where all the talks happen. Head over here to listen to the speakers\nSessions Sessions is an area for smaller talks, round-tables and discussions with up to 10 on camera and an audience of 500. Not only can we schedule sessions throughout the conference, but you can create them too. We\u0026rsquo;ve left sessions open for impromptu meetings. Anyone can create a session by just clicking on Create Session, filling in a few details and adding an optional picture.\nSessions can be open, meaning anyone can go on camera, or moderated, meaning that you can manage who goes on camera. Anyone and everyone can watch sessions. Want to follow up with a speaker? Invite them to a session over a virtual coffee!\nNetworking Networking is our speed-networking area. When you join you\u0026rsquo;ll be randomly paired with another conference attendee for two minutes and both go on camera. It\u0026rsquo;s a great way to meet new people, and we all have something in common! Please consider trying it out - everyone at R/Pharma is nice!\nExpo The expo is our virtual exhibition hall. R/Pharma does not work with sponsors and we promote opensource so the exhibition hall is not a traditional one. We\u0026rsquo;re using this space to give people a chance to showcase their R packages and shiny apps. When you enter a booth you can see a video or set of slides highlighting a package or app (note: if slides run too fast you can adjust the speed through the settings at the bottom of the screen).\nWhen the author is present in the booth they can interact with you and even show a live demo. The expo will be open throughout the entire three days of the conference - come check it out.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to add a booth, more details are in this blog entry.\rOther parts of the screen You\u0026rsquo;ll notice a collapsible pane on the right which contains tabs for Chat, Polls and People.\n Chat is the conference chat feed. There are several chat feeds at a hopin event. The Event feed is available wherever you are in a hopin event and there are additional chat feeds which will pop up depending on which area you\u0026rsquo;re in:  stage chat - available when you\u0026rsquo;re at the stage. Use this to post questions for the speaker. If the speaker does not have enough time to respond we\u0026rsquo;ll re-post the questions in slack for follow-up. sessions chat - Each session (see Sessions above) has its own chat feed. If you are an audience member you can interact with those on camera through this chat feed. expo chat - Each expo booth has its own chat feed. You can use this feed to leave messages for a booth owner (when they\u0026rsquo;re not available) or just say something nice about their package.   Polls are a way for conference organizers to gain feedback. People lets you see who\u0026rsquo;s here. You can also direct message any attendee.  R/Pharma aims to provide amazing workshops and presentations within a highly social atmosphere. This is clearly more challenging in a virtual environment and we hope you enjoy the conference and have the chance to make some new connections.

In 2018 and 2019 the conference was held in the Tsai Auditorium at the Center for Government and International Studies, Harvard University and capped at 150 attendees. The conference was run as a free event. Invitations were based on committee membership and advisory support, speaker acceptance, academic/student and diversity.\nThe conference has been run with single track consisting of keynotes from renowned industry practitioners to key R developers to leading academics. In addition there were a number of pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.\nFor 2020 we are taking a hiatus from holding the meeting at Harvard and will be running a virtual conference. More details will follow.\nOur entire event is a community-lead effort and 100% volunteer run. The event is vendor neutral and very much an academic conference. Harvard has been very helpful in hosting the event.\nR/Pharma is an ISC working group\runder the R Consortium. The conference is a relatively small, scientifically \u0026amp; industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The conference covers topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research \u0026amp; development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All are discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development process. The conference showcases the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery \u0026amp; development, and clinical initiatives.
