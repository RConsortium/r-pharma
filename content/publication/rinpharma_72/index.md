abstract: Our bioinformatics team is relied upon to quickly generate information to drive business decisions, allocate resources, and develop predictive models. As such, we constantly strive to streamline our work and create efficiencies when possible. To this end, we have developed a set of tools utilizing R packages, project templates, and parameterized R Markdown reports that enables a semi-automated, standardized modeling work flow. These tools have largely increased our output in generating informative metrics, improved our ability to reproduce our results, and empowered us to scale our team in a way that supports our company goals.
