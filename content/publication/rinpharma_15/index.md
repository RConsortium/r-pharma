abstract: In this talk, I will speak about my personal journey of learning R and transforming from a clinical study statistical programmer to a SAS/R bilingual, as well as my journey of leading the R initiative in Amgenâ€™s Global Statistical Programming Department and Amgen R meetup, working with IS, statistician, quality, LMS and external partners. I will conclude by talking about the areas of challenge and the direction of R for statistical programming in a regulated environment and proposals for R in Pharma collaboration.
