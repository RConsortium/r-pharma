      presentation:
        title: "Title TBD"
        description: "The tidyverse (tidyverse.org) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The packages primarily consist of tools for data ingest, manipulation, and visualization. In the last year or so, Rstudio and others have been creating a set of packages focused on the modeling process. In this talk, we will introduce the tidyverse and illustrate these new tools whose goals are to: simplify the modeling process, encourage empirical validation and good methodology, and to enable a wider variety of approaches."

        title: "Title TBD"
        description: "The open-source analytics community is driving innovation in precompetitive spaces like statistical methodology, reproducibility approaches, visualization techniques, and scaling strategies. The diverse and rapidly evolving ecosystem of open-source tools and standards stands in contrast with the disposition of the enterprise towards stability, standardization, and reliability. This talk will present the policies and frameworks we have developed at Genentech to enable internal scientists to responsibly leverage open-source tools and to participate in the community process through their own contributions."
