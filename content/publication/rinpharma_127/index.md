abstract: We will be presenting an overview of the interoperability between Python and R for the R user community at R/Pharma 2020. This workshop will highlight how statistical programmers can leverage the power of both R and Python in their daily processes. Participants will get hands on experience working with some of the best aspects of both R and Python, and how these two languages can work together within R Markdown.
