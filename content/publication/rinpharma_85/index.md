abstract: In a large organization, collaboration faces many obstacles. Groups may inadvertently reinvent functionality and expend redundant effort. Siloing may impede aggregation and comparison of results. Analysts may not be aware of potential collaborators. However, a shared computational analysis environment, supported by centrally developed infrastructure and well-defined policies, enables discoverability, facilitates reuse, promotes communication between analysts, and improves comparability of results. We will present how we are pursuing this vision at Genentech.
