Registration details will be available shortly.\nR/Pharma 2020, the conference on all things R (some python, Julia and Stan too) in Pharma, will take place October 13th-15th 2020, preceded by Training Days the week prior.\nThis year we are particularly interested in talks from people who can’t usually make it in person to Harvard University, or are newer to conference speaking. R/Pharma committee members are offering free speaker coaching: as long as you have an interesting R in pharma idea and are willing to put in some work, we’ll help you develop a great talk. Talks are short (5-10 minutes) high energy presentations that give you the chance to talk about an interesting project that you’ve tackled with R in pharma. Short talks, or demos of your R code, R packages, and shiny apps are great options.\nWe are particularly interested in submissions that have one or more of these qualities:\n Showcase the use of R in clinical trials Your favourite R package and how it significantly eases an entire class of problems for a pharm use-case Expand the use of R in pharma to reach new domains and audiences Combine R with other world class tools, like python, tensorflow, and spark etc. Reporting/Communication using RMarkdown, Shiny, ggplot2, or something else altogether Discuss how to teach R/data science effectively in pharma Talks on administering R in pharma and tackling scaling, packages, cloud, HPC etc.  Applications close August 31st, and you’ll be notified of our decision on Sept 7th.\nTo apply, please click on the button at the end of this post and submit your title and abstract to introduce you and your proposed topic. If you prefer, you can email your submission to info@rinpharma.com\nThere are 5-10 minute long talks that are scheduled alongside talks by invited speakers. We are looking for interesting topics and engaging speakers on the entire drug development process, medical devices and other pharma related topics.\nAPPLY NOW!\nBy participating in R/Pharma 2020, you consent to audio and video recording by any means and form of your workshop, presentation, lecture or demonstration as a speaker or as an attendee.

In 2018 and 2019 the conference was held in the Tsai Auditorium at the Center for Government and International Studies, Harvard University and capped at 150 attendees. The conference was run as a free event. Invitations were based on committee membership and advisory support, speaker acceptance, academic/student and diversity.\nThe conference has been run with single track consisting of keynotes from renowned industry practitioners to key R developers to leading academics. In addition there were a number of pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.\nFor 2020 we are taking a hiatus from holding the meeting at Harvard and will be running a virtual conference. More details will follow.\nOur entire event is a community-lead effort and 100% volunteer run. The event is vendor neutral and very much an academic conference. Harvard has been very helpful in hosting the event.\nR/Pharma is an ISC working group\runder the R Consortium. The conference is a relatively small, scientifically \u0026amp; industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The conference covers topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research \u0026amp; development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All are discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development process. The conference showcases the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery \u0026amp; development, and clinical initiatives. (Note that topics related to the use of R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and researchers is the focus of R/Medicine.\rR/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability or any feature that distinguishes human beings.
