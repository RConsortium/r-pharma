abstract: R is the dominant language in modern quantitative science, however it is still not widely used in pharma industry. In this talk I will share learnings in building an internal R user community in a large global organization, via efforts including cataloging existing works, coordinating R adoption pilots and trainings, etc. In addition, I will share our experiences and challenges in building a streamlined workflow with an automated writing component to enhance efficiency and reproducibility in a recent health authority interaction, towarding our mission of bringing therapies to patients faster.
